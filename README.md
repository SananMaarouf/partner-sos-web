# PartnerSOS (Web)

## Overview
**PartnerSOS (Web)** is a companion web application designed to work seamlessly with the PartnerSOS mobile app. The mobile app allows users to share their location with their partners when they feel unsafe. With a single tap—fewer taps than using apps like Messenger or Snapchat to share location—users can quickly notify their partners.
